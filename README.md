An epic narrative of mathematics

The other thing to say is something that I probably heard on Overcoming Bias or Marginal Revolution -- just that essentially every respected institution in the world is allied with academia, and those that try to fight academia lose.  Universities have weathered tremendous societal change, and in the end even those selling verified certificates are still "partnering" with traditional IHEs.

For that matter, not only has every respected institution allied with academia, but they've allied with math departments.  Calculus and the enlightenment was just the start.  That the system of the heavens is also the system for settling debts has placed mathematics at the very center of civilization.  Place-value is a story that might be seen as starting with Archimedes and the Sand Reckoner, and somehow ends up involving Italian bookkeepers and then makes possible modern science.

And math is beating technology.  If you look at Page 97 (labeled 71) of

you read: "[A] benchmark production planning model solved using linear programming would have taken 82 years to solve in 1988, using the computers and the linear programming algorithms of the day.  Fifteen years later – in 2003 – this same model could be solved in roughly 1 minute, an improvement by a factor of roughly 43 million.  Of this, a factor of roughly 1,000 was due to increased processor speed, whereas a factor of roughly 43,000 was due to improvements in algorithms!  Grötschel also cites an algorithmic improvement of roughly 30,000 for mixed integer programming between 1991 and 2008."  Lots of businesses are using linear models, and the fact that the can solve them in a reasonable amount of time is due more to mathematicians than the computers.  Math provides the coding theory that goes into wifi and mobile phones, that makes DVDs work after they're scratched, the crypto that makes online purchasing work, the spherical trigonometry that made naval empires possible and now the general relativity that makes GPS possible, Nash equilibrium, spectroscopy, PDEs in biology and medicine, representation theory in solid state physics, singular value decomposition for Google PageRank, complex analysis to design antennas, functional analysis for machine learning and spam filters...  That there's a unified domain of human inquiry which does all this is utterly ridiculous.

Math departments are basically Hogwarts.  And yet, we fail to get people to enroll...

If all the mathematicians stopped working, the world would grind to a halt in 150 years,
